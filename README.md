# stock-tracker

1.	Introduction
This a solution for a customer who wants to be able to track specific stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, by customizing their experience. The user will be able to select their stock of interest, input their required upper and lower threshold values and monitor it through a user-friendly dynamic graph. They now will not have to search through multiple stocks and can easily be notified when desired values are reached, making their investment journey more efficient, helping them make better, well-informed, and timely financial decisions. 

	Some things that have been utilized to build the requirements of this project are asking potential customers for input, doing a competitive analysis of current similar tracking tools, and reviewing business and policy procedures (to make sure everything is in accordance with trading regulations). Doing these things will give us a strong base on how to build our project. Next, diagrams (use-case or activity) will be used to show these requirements and actors will interact with each other, like the data from NYSE, customer, and system. An agile driven (possibly incremental) approach is used. 

2.	Project Goals and Problem Definition

The Goal of our project is to create a web application that allows users to track price fluctuations in their stocks of interest through an interactive user-friendly interface that displays a dynamic graph of stock prices in real time, with a notification system that notifies the users when their desired values are reached. 

To attain our project goals, we must first form a well-defined problem definition. We must thus: 
-	Implement a feature that allows a new user to input their username and password to sign up, after which a notification pops-up indicating that the user has signed up
-	Implement a feature that allows the user to input their username and password to login, after which a notification pops-up indicating that the user has logged in
-	integrate a functionality that allows users to choose the stocks they wish to monitor
-	input a feature that allows users to input their pre-set threshold and loss-stop values.
-	Implement a checker in place to ensure values inputted into the system are valid (no letters, special characters, etc.) 
-	Implement a notification system in place that will inform the user if the pre-set threshold and stop-loss value is reached. 
-	Implement a dynamic graph that will display the past week/month price trends of the selected stocks


3.	Project Deliverables 

This section documents our team’s goals for the product release. Our project deliverables will be divided into the following points. 

1.	business operations, performance, and requirements analysis reports: a brief report on the overall performance of the management team and product delivery team. 

2.	software specification documents and systems architecture: has a list of user, business, and functional features required by the stakeholders that are to be implemented on our web app. for example, our application must
- be able to import data from NYSE in real-time
- display a login and sign-up page 
- display a search bar for the user's entry of the specific stock they want to track 
- output the user input’s stock's chart 
- notify the user of abnormal fluctuations in stock price and when the right time to invest is 

3.	final product(external deliverable): investment tracker software source code and project binder.
final product:  investment tracker software source code
user input: name of stock and user account 
system output: dynamic graph that displays stock prices in real-time and sends notifications during abnormal stock price fluctuations 

4.	prototypes and preliminary models that serve as a framework for the whole project and their progress reports and error logs can help estimate the trajectory of the entire project. We will make our prototypes with working code and use case, sequence and activity diagrams. 

5.	risk management, refactoring, and version control report: this report consists of performance logs measured against baseline reports and previous system efficiency logs. This is essential as it will keep track of problems faced during our project and their solutions which might come in handy at later stages in the process. This log also serves as a way to communicate within the team when in need of problem-solving strategies and troubleshooting. It also keeps a log of the various versions of the source code and helps us improve the efficiency of later versions.

The deliverables will be released in the form of the following project binder:
project binder
1. the project report
2. all versions of the software source code  
3. test cases and test data and return reports
4. PowerPoint slides with overall project description
5. video presentation of proposed solution 
6. two use case descriptions and diagrams: for brokers and investors  
7. system architecture 
8. sequence diagram
9. activity diagram
